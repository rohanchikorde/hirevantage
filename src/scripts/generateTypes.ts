// This is a utility script that can be run with Bun or Node.js to generate types
// based on your Supabase database schema.
// 
// To use this, you would run: npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id qvxwcnrdpjpwxdopfiyn --schema public > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
//
// However, we cannot modify the types.ts file directly as specified in the requirements.
// Instead, we're using the type assertions in our supabaseHelpers.ts file as a workaround.
//
// After running the database migrations, we would ideally update the types.ts file,
// but for now we're using type assertions to make TypeScript happy.
