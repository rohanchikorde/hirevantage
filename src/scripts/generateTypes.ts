// This is a utility script that can be run with Bun or Node.js to generate types
// based on your Supabase database schema.
// 
// To use this, you would run: npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id qvxwcnrdpjpwxdopfiyn --schema public > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
//
// However, we cannot modify the types.ts file directly as specified in the requirements.
// Instead, we'll use the type assertions in our supabaseHelpers.ts file as a workaround.
